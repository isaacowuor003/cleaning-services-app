Do you want me to help you write the entire frontend 
page structure?

Do you prefer I host this with Go as soon as it’s done?

Will there be more pages (like Team, Services, 
Booking, etc.), or just one-page scroll?

Once frontend is done, we’ll start working on the 
Go backend (e.g. form handling, database, booking 
system, etc.).

A folder called assets/images/ with your image 
files (like logos, team photos)
